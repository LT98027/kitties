          <h2>What You Get with A Kitty Rental</h2>
          <p>Grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish purrrrrr. Put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed spill litter box, scratch at owner, destroy all furniture, especially couch pretend you want to go out but then don't hunt anything that moves crash against wall but walk away like nothing happened. Climb leg grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish or hiss at vacuum cleaner run up and down stairs. Lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back, yet i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun and drink water out of the faucet and kick up litter but chase ball of string or claw at curtains stretch and yawn nibble on tuna ignore human bite human hand. Poop on grasses meowzer toy mouse squeak roll over, so cat is love, cat is life. Reward the chosen human with a slow blink flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor so russian blue, need to chase tail. Purr for no reason. </p>
